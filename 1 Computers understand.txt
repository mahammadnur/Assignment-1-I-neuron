1)Computers understand coding as a means of communication and instruction. Debugging involves identifying and fixing errors in computer programs. 

Computers use binary code, represented by 0s and 1s, to comprehend information. Binary code manipulates electrical signals in the hardware, interpreting 0 as low voltage (off) and 1 as high voltage (on). This binary system forms the basis for data storage and processing.

2)An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that offers comprehensive tools for code writing, testing, and debugging. It includes features like a text editor, code auto-completion, debugging tools, and project management capabilities.

A text editor is a basic tool for editing plain text, lacking the advanced features specific to programming languages found in an IDE. An IDE provides a specialized environment for code creation and management.

3)Extensions are additional modules or plugins that enhance an IDE's functionality. They can introduce features like syntax highlighting, code formatting, and integration with specific frameworks or libraries.
